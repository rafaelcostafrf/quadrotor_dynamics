# Quadrotor Mathematical Simulation using Python

Is this page we present a numerical quadrotor dynamics simulation, based on Allan's Master thesis. The objective of developing such an algorithm was to enable a reliable and fast way to simulate a variety of controllers without all the hassle of coding the dynamics for every controller. 

The algorithm has the following characteristics:

1. Non-Linear Dynamics
2. Quaternion Attitude Representation 
3. Quaternion Angular Velocity determination
4. Translational and Rotational Drag
5. Proppeler Gyroscopic Effect
6. Machine Learning Reward Function
7. On Board Sensors (IMU).
8. Attitude and Position Estimation based on Popular Algorithms

Please refer to provided jupyter notebook to usage examples.
